    <STRONG><IMG SRC="../images/w_big.gif" WIDTH=69 HEIGHT=53 ALIGN=LEFT ALT="W">HEN</STRONG> the wicked man turneth away from his wickedness that he hath committed, and doeth that which is lawful and right, he shall save his soul alive.  <I>Ezek. </I>xviii. 27.<BR>
    &#160; &#160; I acknowledge my transgressions, and my sin is ever before me.  <I>Psalm </I>li. 3.<BR>
    &#160; &#160; Hide thy face from my sins, and blot out all mine iniquities. <I>Psalm </I>li. 9.<BR>
    &#160; &#160; The sacrifices of God are a broken spirit: a broken and a contrite heart, O God, thou wilt not despise. <I>Psalm</I> li. 17.<BR>
    &#160; &#160; Rend your heart, and not your garments, and turn unto the Lord your God: for he is gracious and merciful, slow to anger, and of great kindness, and repenteth him of the evil. <I>Joel </I>ii. 13.<BR>
    &#160; &#160; To the Lord our God belong mercies and forgivenesses, though we have rebelled against him; neither have we obeyed the voice of the Lord our God, to walk in his laws which he set before us. <I>Daniel </I> ix. 9, 10.<BR>
    &#160; &#160; O Lord, correct me, but with judgment; not in thine anger, lest thou bring me to nothing.  <I>Jer</I>. x. 24.  <I>Psalm</I> vi. 1.<BR>
    &#160; &#160; Repent ye; for the Kingdom of Heaven is at hand.  <I>St. Matt.</I> iii. 2.<BR>
    &#160; &#160; I will arise and go to my father, and will say unto him, Father, I have sinned against heaven, and before thee, and am no more worthy to be called thy son.  <I>St. Luke</I> xv. 18, 19.<BR>
    &#160; &#160; Enter not into judgment with thy servant, O Lord; for in thy sight shall no man living be justified.  <I>Psalm</I> cxliii. 2.<BR>
    &#160; &#160; If we say that we have no sin, we deceive ourselves, and the truth is not in us; but if we confess our sins, God is faithful and just to forgive us our sins, and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness. 1 <I>St. John </I>i. 8, 9.<P>

    <STRONG><IMG SRC="../images/d_small.gif" WIDTH=37 HEIGHT=36 ALIGN=LEFT ALT="D">EARLY</STRONG> beloved brethren, the Scripture moveth us, in sundry places, to acknowledge and confess our manifold sins and wickedness; and that we should not dissemble nor cloak them before the face of Almighty God our heavenly Father; but confess them with an humble,
      lowly, penitent, and obedient heart; to the end that we may obtain forgiveness of the same, by his infinite goodness and mercy. And although we ought, at all times, humbly to acknowledge our sins before God; yet ought we chiefly so to do, when we assemble and meet together to render thanks for the great benefits that we have received at his hands, to set forth his
      most worthy praise, to hear his most holy Word, and to ask those things which are requisite and necessary, as well for the body as the soul. Wherefore I pray and beseech you, as many as are here present, to accompany me with a pure heart, and humble voice, unto the throne of the heavenly grace, saying after me;<P>

    <STRONG><IMG SRC="../images/a_small.gif" WIDTH=38 HEIGHT=37 ALIGN=LEFT ALT="A">LMIGHTY</STRONG> and most merciful Father; We have erred, and strayed from thy ways like lost sheep. We have followed too much the devices and desires of our own hearts. We have offended against thy holy laws. We have left undone those things which we ought to have done;
      And we have done those things which we ought not to have done; And there is no health in us. But thou, O Lord, have mercy upon us, miserable offenders. Spare thou them, O God, who confess their faults. Restore thou them that are penitent; According to thy promises declared unto mankind in Christ Jesu our Lord. And grant, O most merciful Father, for his
      sake; That we may hereafter live a godly, righteous, and sober life, To the glory of thy holy Name. Amen.<P>

    <STRONG><IMG SRC="../images/a_small.gif" WIDTH=38 HEIGHT=37 ALIGN=LEFT ALT="A">LMIGHTY</STRONG> God, the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who desireth not the death of a sinner, but rather that he may turn from his wickedness, and live; and hath given power, and commandment, to his Ministers, to declare and pronounce to his people, being penitent, the
      Absolution and Remission of their sins : He pardoneth and absolveth all them that truly repent, and unfeignedly believe his holy Gospel.  Wherefore let us beseech him to grant us true repentance, and his Holy Spirit, that those things may please him, which we do at this present; and that the rest of our life hereafter may be pure, and holy; so that at the last we may
      come to his eternal joy; through Jesus Christ our Lord.<P>
