    <STRONG><IMG SRC="../images/o_big.gif" WIDTH=48 HEIGHT=53 ALIGN=LEFT ALT="O"> GOD,</STRONG> heavenly Father, who by thy Son Jesus Christ hast promised to all those who seek thy kingdom, and the righteousness thereof, all things necessary to their bodily sustenance; Send us, we beseech thee, in this our necessity, such moderate rain and showers, that we may
      receive the fruits of the earth to our comfort, and to thy honour; through Jesus Christ our Lord. <I>Amen</I>.<P>

    <CENTER><FONT COLOR = "Red"><EM>For Fair Weather.</EM></FONT></CENTER>
    <STRONG><IMG SRC="../images/o_small.gif" WIDTH=34 HEIGHT=36 ALIGN=LEFT ALT="O"> ALMIGHTY</STRONG> Lord God, who for the sin of man didst once drown all the world, except eight persons, and afterward of thy great mercy didst promise never to destroy it so again; We humbly beseech thee, that although we for our iniquities have worthily deserved a plague of
      rain and waters, yet upon our true repentance thou wilt send us such weather, as that we may receive the fruits of the earth in due season; and learn both by thy punishment to amend our lives, and for thy clemency to give thee praise and glory; through Jesus Christ our Lord. <I>Amen</I>.<P>

    <CENTER><FONT COLOR = "Red"><EM>In Time of Dearth and Famine.</EM></FONT></CENTER>
    <STRONG><IMG SRC="../images/o_small.gif" WIDTH=34 HEIGHT=36 ALIGN=LEFT ALT="O"> GOD</STRONG>, heavenly Father, whose gift it is that the rain doth fall, the earth is fruitful, beasts do increase, and fishes do multiply; Behold, we beseech thee, the afflictions of thy people; and grant that the scarcity and dearth, which we do now most justly suffer for our iniquity,
      may, through thy goodness be mercifully turned into cheapness and plenty; for the love of Jesus Christ our Lord, to whom, with thee and the Holy Ghost, be all honour and glory, now and for ever. <I>Amen</I>.<P>

    <CENTER><FONT COLOR = "Red"><EM>Or this</EM></FONT>.</CENTER>
    <STRONG><IMG SRC="../images/o_small.gif" WIDTH=34 HEIGHT=36 ALIGN=LEFT ALT="O"> GOD</STRONG>, merciful Father, who, in the time of Elisha the prophet, didst suddenly in Samaria turn great scarcity and dearth into plenty and cheapness; Have mercy upon us, that we, who are now for our sins punished with like adversity, may likewise find a seasonable relief :
      Increase the fruits of the earth by thy heavenly benediction; and grant that we, receiving thy bountiful liberality, may use the same to thy glory, the relief of those that are needy, and our own comfort; through Jesus Christ our Lord.  <I>Amen</I>.<P>

    <CENTER><FONT COLOR = "Red"><EM>In the time of War and Tumults.</EM></FONT></CENTER>
    <STRONG><IMG SRC="../images/o_small.gif" WIDTH=34 HEIGHT=36 ALIGN=LEFT ALT="O"> ALMIGHTY</STRONG> God, King of all kings, and Governor of all things, whose power no creature is able to resist, to whom it belongeth justly to punish sinners, and to be merciful to those who truly repent; Save and deliver us, we humbly beseech thee, from the hands of our
      enemies; abate their pride, assuage their malice, and confound their devices; that we, being armed with thy defence, may be preserved evermore from all perils, to glorify thee, who art the only giver of all victory; through the merits of thy Son, Jesus Christ our Lord. <I>Amen</I>.<P>

    <CENTER><FONT COLOR = "Red"><EM>In the time of any common Plague or Sickness</EM></FONT></CENTER>
    <STRONG><IMG SRC="../images/o_small.gif" WIDTH=34 HEIGHT=36 ALIGN=LEFT ALT="O"> ALMIGHTY</STRONG> God, who in thy wrath did send a plague upon thine own people in the wilderness, for their obstinate rebellion against Moses and Aaron; and also, in the time of king David, didst slay with the plague of Pestilence threescore and ten thousand, and yet
      remembering thy mercy didst save the rest; Have pity upon us miserable sinners, who now are visited with great sickness and mortality; that like as thou didst then accept of an atonement, and didst command the destroying Angel to cease from punishing, so it may now please thee to withdraw from us this plague and grievous sickness; through Jesus Christ our
      Lord.  <I>Amen</I>.<P>

    <STRONG><IMG SRC="../images/a_small.gif" WIDTH=38 HEIGHT=37 ALIGN=LEFT ALT="A">LMIGHTY</STRONG> God, our heavenly Father, who hast purchased to thyself an universal Church by the precious blood of thy dear Son; Mercifully look upon the same, and at this time so guide and govern the minds of thy servants the Bishops and Pastors of thy flock, that they may
      lay hands suddenly on no man, but faithfully and wisely make choice of fit persons, to serve in the sacred Ministry of thy Church. And to those which shall be ordained to any holy function, give thy grace and heavenly benediction; that both by their life and doctrine they may show forth thy glory, and set forward the salvation of all men; through Jesus Christ our
      Lord. <I>Amen. </I><P>

    <STRONG><IMG SRC="../images/a_small.gif" WIDTH=38 HEIGHT=37 ALIGN=LEFT ALT="A">LMIGHTY</STRONG> God, the giver of all good gifts, who of thy divine providence hast appointed divers Orders in thy Church; Give thy grace, we humbly beseech thee, to all those who are to be called to any office and administration in the same; and so replenish them with the truth
      of thy doctrine, and endue them with innocency of life, that they may faithfully serve before thee, to the glory of thy great Name, and the benefit of thy holy Church; through Jesus Christ our Lord. <I>Amen</I>.<P>

      the advancement of thy glory, the good of thy Church, the safety, honour, and welfare of our Sovereign and his Dominions; that all things may be so ordered and settled by their endeavours, upon the best and surest foundations, that peace and happiness, truth and justice, religion and piety, may be established among us for all generations. These and all other
      necessaries, for them, for us, and thy whole Church, we humbly beg in the Name and Mediation of Jesus Christ, our most blessed Lord and Saviour. <I>Amen.</I><P>

      Church; that it may be so guided and governed by thy good Spirit, that all who profess and call themselves Christians may be led into the way of truth, and hold the faith in unity of spirit, in the bond of peace, and in righteousness of life.  Finally, we commend to thy fatherly goodness all those, who are any ways afflicted, or distressed, in mind, body, or estate;
      [*<I>especially those for whom our prayers are desired;</I>] that it may please thee to comfort and relieve them, according to their several necessities, giving them patience under their sufferings, and a happy issue out of all their afflictions.  And this we beg for Jesus Christ his sake.  <I>Amen.</I><BR>
